# Laraddress

## About Laraddress

Laraddress is a federated address book.

## Current Features

*  Run your own address book server, own your data
*  Friends can login and update their address book info
*  Share your contact details in return
*  Contact details include:
    - Name and Birthday
    - Addresses
    - Email Accounts
    - Website and Blogs
    - Social Media Accounts

## Future Features

### Really Simple Federation [RSF]

If your friend also runs an address book server,
have their contact information automatically imported
and kept up-to-date.

### Tagging

You can add tags to contacts as a way of grouping them
by relationship, by interests, or whatever tags you wish
to create and use. Only you can see your tags. You will
use them when filtering and sorting your contact list.

### Privacy Restrictions

When your contacts share their information with you,
they also get to see your contact information. You may
not want every contact knowing all of your contact
information. Therefor, it is neccessary that you can
set the privacy for each piece of contact information
to be viewed by anyone, only other contacts, or only
to specific groups of contacts. (those groups will
be defined by tags)

### Other Misc Future Features

*  Show a google map of where all of your friends live.
